# Exordium
# Housekeeping

I have put considerable effort into avoiding sarcasm or misrepresentations, choosing instead to approach discussions with charity, humility, and meekness. My desire is that we can engage in this conversation without resorting to behavior that goes against the principles becoming of Christians.

All from the ESV unless otherwise stated. Quotes from the [Wisdom of Solomon are NRSV](https://biblia.com/bible/nrsv/wisdom-of-solomon/13)

This post was written in response to [Craig Trulia's reflections on Wisdom of Solomon:14](https://orthodoxchristiantheology.com/2022/10/11/wisdom-14-icons-and-idols/).

I had originally intended to simply correct a poor exegesis of the text. Once I started I realized that a comprehensive treatment of the Wisdom of Solomon was needed to address the errors. In doing so I became convicted regarding the nature of idolatry, and the ways in which the bible talks about it. From there I sought scriptural support, and realizing that I'd be talking to Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholics I would also need patristic support. So, now my aim is to illustrate that the Bible has consistent critiques idol worship, and the Wisdom of Solomon also addresses idols with the same critiques. These critiques is present in New Testament, the historical witness, and in the patristics. Moreover, I believe that these critiques are applicable to the practices of icon veneration and certain forms of relic veneration.

This post is an internal critique of Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism, this post is not intended to advocate for any particular alternative, but instead judges Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism on their own terms.

# The stakes

The Wisdom of Solomon (Wis) is scripture for the Eastern Orthodox. As per The Confession of Dositheus as confirmed by the Synod of Jerusalem (1672):

>  ... we call Sacred Scripture all those which Cyril [Lucaris] collected from the Synod of Laodicea, and enumerated... specifically, “The Wisdom of Solomon,” ... All of these we also judge to be Canonical Books, and confess them to be Sacred Scripture. [Decree 18, Q3](http://www.crivoice.org/creeddositheus.html)

Wis is scripture for the Roman Catholics. As per The Council of Trent:

> And it has thought it meet that a list of the sacred books be inserted in this decree, lest a doubt may arise in any one's mind, which are the books that are received by this Synod. They are as set down here below: ... Wisdom [Session 4, First Decree](http://www.thecounciloftrent.com/ch4.htm)

For the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholics, Wis is the word of God its authority is on par with the red letters of the gospels. If an apostle, saint, pope, or council were to contradict it, then they would be forced to side with the Wis and condemn the other. 

The Second Council of Nicaea directly anathematizes any who would apply the scriptures against idol to the icons. 

> To those who apply to the sacred images the sayings in divine scriptures against idol anathema! ... To those who call the sacred images idols anathema! [The acts of the Second Council of Nicaea (287), Richard Price, 2020 p577]

Both the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches hold the Second Council of Nicaea to be infallible. To question its validity would essentially imply that the entire Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism are fundamentally flawed. If the Wisdom of Solomon condemns the religious use of icons, it would also cast condemnation on the canons and councils of both Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism. The implications are significant and carry substantial consequences.




# Roadmap

Given this there are a few points of contention we may explore:

1. Does Wis 14:1-11 intend to create a dichotomy between ingenuity in accordance with God's will and ingenuity in accordance with man's (sinful) will?
2. Does Wis condemn the idolaters and their idols solely because they are not rightly and piously using things created by human hands?
3. Does Wis 14:7 "For blessed is the wood by which righteousness comes" describe the outcome of God's will paired with human ingenuity?
4. Does Wis 14 argue for a rightly order and faithful use of things created by human hands for veneration (i.e. cross veneration).

To answer this I will:

1. Ground us in the greater context of Wis to understand its conception of wisdom and the critiques it makes of idolatry and its forms.
2. Consider how Wis's commentaries on idolatry relates to other commentaries on idolatry in scripture.
3. Read Wis 14 in this context and determine its actual meaning.
4. Relate all of this to the Second Council of Nicaea (787) and its broader implications for the church.

Not to bury the lead, **the Wisdom of Solomon condemns the veneration/honour/worship of inanimate objects regardless of intent or what they visually or symbolically represent. It uses the same language repeated in the old testament, new testament, and the early church.**

# Wisdom in the Wisdom of Solomon

Wis shares a similar format with Proverbs, presenting a collection of concise and insightful sayings. It emerged during a time of conflict between Jewish culture and Hellenic culture, likely in an Alexandrian (Egyptian) setting. The chapters of particular interest are 13 to 15, which delve into the folly of idolatry. These chapters are part of a broader context that compares Egypt and Israel in terms of their righteousness, sins, and how God has dealt with them.  To follow along, its worth reading chapters 7+, but honestly its not a long book and it is filled with wisdom so maybe read the whole thing.

To fully grasp the meaning of Wis, it's essential to comprehend the significance of "Wisdom" in the text. Contrary to an abstract mental concept, Wisdom is personified, akin to the portrayal found in Proverbs. "She" is described as a powerful spirit that directly influences history, somewhat resembling the Holy Spirit. 

> 25 For she is a breath of the power of God, and a pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty; therefore nothing defiled gains entrance into her. 26 For she is a reflection of eternal light, a spotless mirror of the working of God, and an image of his goodness. 27 Although she is but one, she can do all things, and while remaining in herself, she renews all things; in every generation she passes into holy souls and makes them friends of God, and prophets; 28 for God loves nothing so much as the person who lives with wisdom. [Wis: 7:25-28]

Wis, written from the perspective of King Solomon, recounts Solomon's love affair with the woman Wisdom. He desires her from his youth:

> 2 I loved her and sought her from my youth; I desired to take her for my bride, and became enamored of her beauty. [Wis: 8:2]

The story progresses, Solomon pursues her eventually making her is wife.


> 9 Therefore I determined to take her to live with me, knowing that she would give me good counsel and encouragement in cares and grief. [Wis: 8:9]

> 16 When I enter my house, I shall find rest with her; for companionship with her has no bitterness, and life with her has no pain, but gladness and joy.  [Wis: 8:16]

The extent to which honour is piled onto Wisdom can not be understated:

> 22 for wisdom, the fashioner of all things, taught me. There is in her a spirit that is intelligent, holy, unique, manifold, subtle, mobile, clear, unpolluted, distinct, invulnerable, loving the good, keen, irresistible, 23 beneficent, humane, steadfast, sure, free from anxiety, all-powerful, overseeing all, and penetrating through all spirits that are intelligent, pure, and altogether subtle. 24 For wisdom is more mobile than any motion; because of her pureness she pervades and penetrates all things. [Wis: 7:22-24]

Chapter 10 is a greatest hits for the personified Wisdom. It's a series of short recaps of key bible stories saying how it was Wisdom that saved the day. Everything that goes well is attributed to Her. Wisdom is given credit for Noah, Lot, Moses, Joseph and more. The key verse for us here is Wis 10:4

> 4 When the earth was flooded because of him [Cain], wisdom again saved it, steering the righteous man [Noah] by a paltry piece of wood [Wis: 10:4] 

Noah was not "wise", he did not "have wisdom". The narrative intentionally diminishes the significance of the wood used in the ark to emphasize the greatness of his true savior. Although Noah drifts rudderless on a raft, it is Wisdom that rescues him and guides him. The repeated point throughout the story is that even with the smallest and most insignificant means, salvation is brought forth by Wisdom. She alone becomes his savior.


# Idols in the Wisdom of Solomon

Chapter 6 gives us a foretaste of the principle that will be hammered home throughout the text.

> 7 For the Lord of all will not stand in awe of anyone, or show deference to greatness; because he himself made both small and great, and he takes thought for all alike. [Wis: 6:7]

There is an order to the universe. God, the creator of all things, is above his creation. God does not show deference for his creation. Get ready to see this a lot; creator does not bow before creation.

One last pit stop before Chapter 13. Throughout Wis is the theme of mockery and foolishness. In Wis the wicked are not just evil, they are also stupid. The text beats you over the head screaming that if you worship idols you're an idiot.

> 23 Therefore those who lived unrighteously, in a life of folly, you tormented through their own abominations. 24 For they went far astray on the paths of error, accepting as gods those animals that even their enemies despised; they were deceived like foolish infants. 25 Therefore, as though to children who cannot reason, you sent your judgment to mock them. [Wis: 12:23-25] 

To understand Wis we must understand the contempt it has for the unrighteous as this translates to irony and sarcasm all through the text. Read chapter 2 if you don't believe me.

Next we jump to Chapter 13 where the author begins an exploration idolatry in 6 movements:

## The foolishness of worshipping a dead thing (stars) [Wis: 13:1-9]


We begin:

> 13 For all people who were ignorant of God were foolish by nature; and they were unable from the good things that are seen to know the one who exists, nor did they recognize the artisan while paying heed to his works; [Wis: 13:1]

If you pay heed to the creation rather than the creator then you're fool and ignorant of God.

> 5 For from the greatness and beauty of created things comes a corresponding perception of their Creator. 6 Yet these people are little to be blamed, for perhaps they go astray while seeking God and desiring to find him. [Wis: 13:5-6]

Solomon contemplates the worship of nature and celestial entities, emphasizing that when heathens seek God, they are awestruck by the grandeur of creation. However, rather than directing their reverence towards the creator, they mistakenly worship the creation itself. While Solomon does not endorse this error, he can empathize with their perspective to some extent.

> 8 Yet again, not even they are to be excused; 9 for if they had the power to know so much that they could investigate the world, how did they fail to find sooner the Lord of these things? [Wis: 13:8-9]

Nevertheless, and this fact should instill fear in all of us, ignorance cannot be used as an excuse. Idolatry remains inexcusable, regardless of the purity of your intentions, the sincerity with which you sought God, or the devoutness of your actions in that erroneous belief. Your mistakes will not be pardoned. A crucial question to ponder is: If you unintentionally fall into idolatry due to ignorance or error, does it impact your salvation?

Solomon's comments are later support by Paul:

> 19 For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. 20 For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. 21 For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Claiming to be wise, they became fools, 23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things. 24 Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, 25 because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen. [Romans 1:19-25]

Idolatry brings about a feeble mind. Even so, we "are without excuse" and must not worship or serve "the creature rather than the Creator". The majesty of the cosmos itself is witness to the glory of God, and we will receive all the more judgement if we know God and do not honor him as God.

## The foolishness of worshipping a dead thing (wood) [Wis: 13:10-19]

The next movement directly criticizes painted images of men as their adorers set "their hopes set on dead things".

> 10 But miserable, with their hopes set on dead things, are those who give the name “gods” to the works of human hands, gold and silver fashioned with skill, and likenesses of animals, or a useless stone, the work of an ancient hand. [Wis: 13:10]

The critique presented is quite intricate, necessitating careful examination. Wis acknowledges the existence of demons and false gods, acknowledging the presence of dark powers within heathen idols. Labeling something as God when it isn't God constitutes a sin, but there is more to consider. This critique delves beyond whether the spiritual being they worship is genuine or holy.

In Solomon's perspective, when people place their hopes in a created object that has a connection to a spiritual entity, they are still ultimately placing their hopes in a created thing. Consequently, they not only engage in idolatry of the mind by directing prayers to something other than God, but they also become idolaters of matter by praying to the creation itself. Worshipping matter is considered even worse than idolatry of the mind, as it involves not only ceasing to worship God but also placing hope in trivial and unworthy things.

Merely attributing worship to the LORD is insufficient; otherwise, the Golden Calf would have been a misunderstanding rather than an abomination deserving extermination.

> 4 And he received the gold from their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool and made a golden calf. And they said, “These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!” 5 When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it. And Aaron made a proclamation and said, “Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Lord.” [Exodus: 32:4-5]

In typical Wis fashion, irony shines through in the parable of a man who takes a tree and skillfully crafts it into a vessel, firewood, and eventually, an icon.

> 11 A skilled woodcutter may saw down a tree easy to handle and skillfully strip off all its bark, and then with pleasing workmanship make a useful vessel that serves life’s needs, 12 and burn the cast-off pieces of his work to prepare his food, and eat his fill. 13 But a cast-off piece from among them, useful for nothing, a stick crooked and full of knots, he takes and carves with care in his leisure, and shapes it with skill gained in idleness; he forms it in the likeness of a human being, 14 or makes it like some worthless animal, giving it a coat of red paint and coloring its surface red and covering every blemish in it with paint; 15 then he makes a suitable niche for it, and sets it in the wall, and fastens it there with iron. [Wis: 13:11-15]

You should already see the absurdity of it, and the direct connection to the use of icons.

> 16 He takes thought for it, so that it may not fall, because he knows that it cannot help itself, for it is only an image and has need of help. [Wis: 13:16]

Figures are helpless, and our treatment of them show this. Our picture stands, rests, hangers, and frames all condemn the helpless nature of mere pictures.

> 17 When he prays about possessions and his marriage and children, he is not ashamed to address a lifeless thing. [Wis: 13:17]

Again, regardless of the spirit (good or evil) that might be listening or receiving your prayers, when you address an object you are addressing a lifeless thing.

> 18 For health he appeals to a thing that is weak; for life he prays to a thing that is dead; for aid he entreats a thing that is utterly inexperienced; for a prosperous journey, a thing that cannot take a step; 19 for money-making and work and success with his hands he asks strength of a thing whose hands have no strength. [Wis: 13:18-19]

Rather than condemning the things appealed for, the idolater is a fool for appealing to a thing so utterly less than its maker. It is not a matter of whether or not the thing that you pray to has power behind it, it is a matter of whether or not the focal point of your worship is a dead created thing.

But this all should be familiar to you because an extremely similar story is told in Isaiah.

> 13 The carpenter stretches a line; he marks it out with a pencil. He shapes it with planes and marks it with a compass. He shapes it into the figure of a man, with the beauty of a man, to dwell in a house. 14 He cuts down cedars, or he chooses a cypress tree or an oak and lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest. He plants a cedar and the rain nourishes it. 15 Then it becomes fuel for a man. He takes a part of it and warms himself; he kindles a fire and bakes bread. Also he makes a god and worships it; he makes it an idol and falls down before it. 16 Half of it he burns in the fire. Over the half he eats meat; he roasts it and is satisfied. Also he warms himself and says, “Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire!” 17 And the rest of it he makes into a god, his idol, and falls down to it and worships it. He prays to it and says, “Deliver me, for you are my god!” [Isaiah: 44:13-17]

In this scenario, a man takes a piece of wood and utilizes it in various ways: cooking dinner, keeping himself warm by burning it, and then he goes on to carve an image from the remaining wood, worshiping it by bowing down before it. Isaiah, observing the misguided actions of the carpenter, rightfully denounces the act of prostrating oneself before a mere block of wood, recognizing it as an abomination.

> 18 They know not, nor do they discern, for he has shut their eyes, so that they cannot see, and their hearts, so that they cannot understand. 19 No one considers, nor is there knowledge or discernment to say, “Half of it I burned in the fire; I also baked bread on its coals; I roasted meat and have eaten. And shall I make the rest of it an abomination? Shall I fall down before a block of wood?” [Isaiah: 44:18-19]

To create an image and to confuse that image for what is actually life giving is fraud.

> 20 He feeds on ashes; a deluded heart has led him astray, and he cannot deliver himself or say, “Is there not a lie in my right hand?” [Isaiah: 44:20]

Isaiah summarizes the absurdity of bowing down to the works of man neatly.

> 9 All who fashion idols are nothing, and the things they delight in do not profit. Their witnesses neither see nor know, that they may be put to shame. 10 Who fashions a god or casts an idol that is profitable for nothing? 11 Behold, all his companions shall be put to shame, and the craftsmen are only human. Let them all assemble, let them stand forth. They shall be terrified; they shall be put to shame together. [Isaiah: 44:9-11]

We find ourselves in good company with this understanding, Justin Martyr (100-165 AD) reaffirms among other criticisms that we do not honour "soulless and dead" objects "that are corruptible and require constant service".

> And neither do we honour with many sacrifices and garlands of flowers such deities as men have formed and set in shrines and called gods; since we see that these are soulless and dead, and have not the form of God (for we do not consider that God has such a form as some say that they imitate to His honour), but have the names and forms of those wicked demons which have appeared. For why need we tell you who already know, into what forms the craftsmen, carving and cutting, casting and hammering, fashion the materials? And often out of vessels of dishonour, by merely changing the form, and making an image of the requisite shape, they make what they call a god; which we consider not only senseless, but to be even insulting to God, who, having ineffable glory and form, thus gets His name attached to things that are corruptible, and require constant service.  [Justin Martyr, 1 Apology 9](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm)

What are we to make of Justin Martyr's comments that God has "ineffable glory and form" or that "we do not consider that God has such a form as some say that they imitate to his honor"? Perhaps I'll address it further another time, but I'd be wary of anyone who's interpretation is that God has an effable glory and form that we can imitate in order to honour him.

Furthermore Tacitus [56-120 AD] describes the practice of the first century Jews, indicating how the commandments of God were interpreted. Of course the knee jerk response to focus on their statements of how God is "incapable of representation", but such hyper-focus misses what else is said. The Jews do not worship objects, but instead with the mind alone. The jews understand it to be wrong to attempt to depict the divine with "perishable materials representations".

>   Egyptians worship many animals and monstrous images; the Jews conceive of one god only, and that with the mind alone: they regard as impious those who make from perishable materials representations of gods in man's image; that supreme and eternal being is to them incapable of representation and without end. [Tacitus, Histories, Book 5:5](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Histories/5A*.html)

Solomon's criticism in Wis is not groundbreaking; rather, it expands upon the teachings of the Old Testament. Its repeated in the new testament, attested to by external witnesses, and continues into the early church. It emphasizes that the issue extends beyond the identity of the deity they worship, the symbolic/artistic accuracy of the image, or the act of prayer, appeal, or adoration. The folly lies in using a lifeless, feeble, inexperienced, weak, and dead object as a religious locus.

## Wisdom of Solomon (14) An orthodox defense

As we enter Chapter 14 its only fair to allow an [Eastern Orthodox interpretation](https://orthodoxchristiantheology.com/2022/10/11/wisdom-14-icons-and-idols/). Trulia is "not aware of any response made to a seemingly devastating prooftext against icons." In his understanding "Saints Theodore the Studite and Nicephorus who hinged their defense of icons on the prototype-type distinction left this passage unaddressed. Nicea 2 did not address it." He cites no fathers, councils, concordances, or commentaries; so his interpretation of this text is entirely his own. The only scripture that he cites to support his interpretation of the text is the Tower of Babel, which he believes demonstrates the scriptures do not provide "condemnation of men using their ingenuity, but rather their using of ingenuity contrary to the will of God."

> 11 Now the whole earth had one language and the same words. 2 And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. 3 And they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. 4 Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth.” 5 And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built. 6 And the Lord said, “Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. 7 Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another's speech.” 8 So the Lord dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. 9 Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth. And from there the Lord dispersed them over the face of all the earth. [Gen 11:1-9]

As Trulia notes "a criticism of iconodulia based upon Wis 14 circumvents the standard Orthodox apologetic", it demands a response because it "contains what appears to be a profound attack on not only the misuse of idols, but the very theology of iconodulia itself."

Trulia's hypothesis is that for things created by human hands there exists a proper and improper usage, and whether or not something is licit is a matter of the intent of the user and creator. Specifically, that if we use things created by human hands "trusting in God, righteousness and blessedness is the result". But if the usage is a manifestation of "vanity" or "trust in princes and sons of men (i.e. themselves)" then evil will ensue.

Trulia bases this off Wis 14:1-8.

>  14 Again, one preparing to sail and about to voyage over raging waves calls upon a piece of wood more fragile than the ship that carries him. 2 For it was desire for gain that planned that vessel, and wisdom was the artisan who built it; 3 but it is your providence, O Father, that steers its course, because you have given it a path in the sea, and a safe way through the waves, 4 showing that you can save from every danger, so that even a person who lacks skill may put to sea. 5 It is your will that works of your wisdom should not be without effect; therefore people trust their lives even to the smallest piece of wood, and passing through the billows on a raft they come safely to land. 6 For even in the beginning, when arrogant giants were perishing, the hope of the world took refuge on a raft, and guided by your hand left to the world the seed of a new generation. 7 For blessed is the wood by which righteousness comes. 8 But the idol made with hands is accursed, and so is the one who made it— he for having made it, and the perishable thing because it was named a god. [Wis: 14:1-8]

His exegesis of this passage is that there is an intentional juxtaposition drawn between "A ship made by man’s ingenuity and God’s sovereignty over its goings". His interpretation is that the text does not condemn human ingenuity but instead ingenuity contrary to God. Therefore, some ingenuity is good and he interprets "For blessed is the wood by which righteousness comes." as exalting the outcomes of God's will paired with human wisdom. Within this paradigm if we rightly and piously use things created by human hands trusting in God, then those things created by human hands and our usage of them is permissible, even desirable.

For Trulia "The reason idols became snares is explicitly attributed to the intent of their creator" and "[the passages] logic appears to demand that there must be a proper use of visible images. Additionally, for the juxtaposition to make sense, the condemnations of honor and worship being given to images must similarly be understood to imply that there are right ways to give honor and worship".

**Tldr; According to Trulia, the Wisdom of Solomon "actually seems to at least argue for cross veneration."**

I had hoped to [steelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning) Trulia's exegesis. In my own investigations I was able to find a single quote bolstering his position: John of Damascus quotes Wis 14. Firstly, for context, John of Damascus wrote the Three Treatises in the eighth century in the middle of the icon dispute. Not only is his commentary extremely late, but aside from Emperor Leo III he's the possibly the most biased person we could consult. 

> If the bones of the righteous are impure, how is it that the bones of Jacob and Joseph were carried out of Egypt with every honor? Or how is it that a dead man was raised after coming in contact with the bones of Elisha? If God works miracles through bones, it is clear that he can also do so through images, stones and many other things. This also happened with Elisha, who gave his staff to his servant and ordered him to go and raise the son of the Shunammite woman with it. Moses too, with a staff, not only punished Pharaoh but also divided the sea, sweetened waters and opened the rock and made water flow out. Solomon says, "Blessed is the wood from which salvation comes." Elisha made a piece of iron float after throwing a stick in the Jordan, and it is also written that "the tree of life" and "the plant of Sabek" lead to forgiveness. Moses lifted up the serpent on a stick, saving the lives of the people, and confirmed the priesthood in the tent with a blooming branch. [John of Damascus, Three Treatises on Divine Images:1.56](www.catenabible.com/ws14)

Strangely, John of Damascus doesn't connect this to Noah (which Trulia correctly does). He does however, argue for icons based on the existence of relics. So going forward we should certainly consider if Wis 14 is presenting a pro-relic and pro-icon stance.
