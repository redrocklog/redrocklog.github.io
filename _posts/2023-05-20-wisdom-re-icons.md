I have tried very hard to avoid snark or mischaraterisation, and instead act with charity, humility, and meekness. I hope that we can discuss this without resorting to behavior unfitting for Christians.

All quotes are NRSV unless otherwise stated: <https://biblia.com/bible/nrsv/wisdom-of-solomon/13>

This post was written in response to [Craig Trulia's reflections on Wis 14](https://orthodoxchristiantheology.com/2022/10/11/wisdom-14-icons-and-idols/). My intention is to demonstrate the bible makes a consistent set of critiques of idol worship, that the Wisdom of Solomon speaks of idols in the same terms, and that these critiques apply to the practice of icon veneration and certain kinds of relic veneration.

This post is an internal critique of Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism, this post is not intended to advocate for any particular alternative, but instead judges Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism on their own terms.

# 2. The stakes

The Wisdom of Solomon (Wis) is scripture for the Eastern Orthodox. As per The Confession of Dositheus as confirmed by the Synod of Jerusalem (1672):

>  ... we call Sacred Scripture all those which Cyril [Lucaris] collected from the Synod of Laodicea, and enumerated... specifically, “The Wisdom of Solomon,” ... All of these we also judge to be Canonical Books, and confess them to be Sacred Scripture. [Decree 18, Q3] <http://www.crivoice.org/creeddositheus.html>

Wis is scripture for the Roman Catholics. As per The Council of Trent:

> And it has thought it meet that a list of the sacred books be inserted in this decree, lest a doubt may arise in any one's mind, which are the books that are received by this Synod. They are as set down here below: ... Wisdom [Session 4, First Decree] <http://www.thecounciloftrent.com/ch4.htm>

For the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholics, Wis is the word of God its authority is on par with the red letters of the gospels. If an apostle, saint, pope, or council were to contradict it, then they would be forced to side with the Wis and condemn the other. 

The Second Council of Nicaea directly anathematizes any who would apply the scriptures against idol to the icons. 

> To those who apply to the sacred images the sayings in divine scriptures against idol anathema! ... To those who call the sacred images idols anathema! [The acts of the Second Council of Nicaea (287), Richard Price, 2020 p577]

The Second Council of Nicaea is held to be infallible by both the the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholics. For it to be wrong is tantamount to the entirety of the Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism being wrong. If Wis condemns the cultic use of icons then the canons and councils of the Eastern Orthodox and the Roman Catholics stand condemned. The stakes are high.


# 3. An orthodox defense

As Trulia notes "a criticism of iconodulia based upon Wis 14 circumvents the standard Orthodox apologetic", it demands a response because it "contains what appears to be a profound attack on not only the misuse of idols, but the very theology of iconodulia itself."

Trulia's hypothesis is that for things created by human hands there exists a proper and improper usage, and whether or not something is licit is a matter of the intent of the user and creator. Specifically, that if we use things created by human hands "trusting in God, righteousness and blessedness is the result". But if the usage is a manifestation of "vanity" or "trust in princes and sons of men (i.e. themselves)" then evil will ensue.

Trulia bases this off Wis 14:1-8.

>  14 Again, one preparing to sail and about to voyage over raging waves calls upon a piece of wood more fragile than the ship that carries him. 2 For it was desire for gain that planned that vessel, and wisdom was the artisan who built it; 3 but it is your providence, O Father, that steers its course, because you have given it a path in the sea, and a safe way through the waves, 4 showing that you can save from every danger, so that even a person who lacks skill may put to sea. 5 It is your will that works of your wisdom should not be without effect; therefore people trust their lives even to the smallest piece of wood, and passing through the billows on a raft they come safely to land. 6 For even in the beginning, when arrogant giants were perishing, the hope of the world took refuge on a raft, and guided by your hand left to the world the seed of a new generation. 7 For blessed is the wood by which righteousness comes. 8 But the idol made with hands is accursed, and so is the one who made it— he for having made it, and the perishable thing because it was named a god. [Wis 14:1-8]

His exegesis of this passage is that there is an intentional juxtaposition drawn between "A ship made by man’s ingenuity and God’s sovereignty over its goings". His interpretation is that the text does not condemn human ingenuity but instead ingenuity contrary to God. Therefore, some ingenuity is good and he interprets "For blessed is the wood by which righteousness comes." as exalting the outcomes of God's will paired with human wisdom. Within this paradigm if we rightly and piously use things created by human hands trusting in God, then those things created by human hands and our usage of them is permissible, even desirable. 


**Tldr; According to Trulia, the Wisdom of Solomon "actually seems to at least argue for cross veneration."**


# 4. Roadmap

Given this there are a few points of contention we may explore:

1. Does Wis 14:1-11 intend to create a dichotomy between ingenuity in accordance with God's will and ingenuity in accordance with man's (sinful) will?
2. Does Wis condemn the idolaters and their idols solely because they are not rightly and piously using things created by human hands?
3. Does Wis 14:7 "For blessed is the wood by which righteousness comes" describe the outcome of God's will paired with human ingenuity?
4. Does Wis 14 argue for a rightly order and faithful use of things created by human hands for veneration (i.e. cross veneration).

To answer this I will:

1. Ground us in the greater context of Wis to understand its conception of wisdom and the critiques it makes of idolatry and its forms.
2. Consider how Wis's commentaries on idolatry relates to other commentaries on idolatry in scripture.
3. Read Wis 14 in this context and determine its actual meaning.
4. Relate all of this to the Second Council of Nicaea (787) and its broader implications for the church.

Not to bury the lead, **the Wisdom of Solomon condemns the veneration/honour/worship of inanimate objects regardless of intent or what they visually or symbolically represent. It uses the same language repeated in the old testament, new testament, and the early church.**



# 5. Wisdom in the Wisdom of Solomon

Wis is similar in format to Proverbs and is a series of short words-of-the-wise. It was written when jewish culture was clashing with hellenic culture, probably in an Alexandrian (Egyptian) content. The part that we're interested in chapters 13-15 which discusses the foolishness of idolatry. 13-15 is in the greater context of comparing egypt to israel in terms of their righteousness, their sin, and how God has treated them. To follow along, its worth reading chapters 10-15, but honestly its not a long book and it is filled with wisdom so maybe read the whole thing.


To understand Wis requires that you understand the role that "Wisdom" plays in the text. Wisdom, echoing the depictions in Proverbs, is not an abstract mental capacity, instead Wisdom is personified. Beyond a mere allegory, Wis describes Her as powerful spirit acting directly upon history in a manner dangerously similar to the Holy Spirit (yes, it uses the feminine pronoun exclusively).

> 25 For she is a breath of the power of God, and a pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty; therefore nothing defiled gains entrance into her. 26 For she is a reflection of eternal light, a spotless mirror of the working of God, and an image of his goodness. 27 Although she is but one, she can do all things, and while remaining in herself, she renews all things; in every generation she passes into holy souls and makes them friends of God, and prophets; 28 for God loves nothing so much as the person who lives with wisdom. [Wis: 7:25-28]

Wis, written from the perspective of King Solomon, recounts Solomon's love affair with the woman Wisdom. He desires her from his youth:

> 2 I loved her and sought her from my youth; I desired to take her for my bride, and became enamored of her beauty. [Wis: 8:2]

The story progresses, Solomon pursues her eventually making her is wife.


> 9 Therefore I determined to take her to live with me, knowing that she would give me good counsel and encouragement in cares and grief. [Wis: 8:9]

> 16 When I enter my house, I shall find rest with her; for companionship with her has no bitterness, and life with her has no pain, but gladness and joy.  [Wis: 8:16]

The extent to which honour is piled onto Wisdom can not be understated:

> 22 for wisdom, the fashioner of all things, taught me. There is in her a spirit that is intelligent, holy, unique, manifold, subtle, mobile, clear, unpolluted, distinct, invulnerable, loving the good, keen, irresistible, 23 beneficent, humane, steadfast, sure, free from anxiety, all-powerful, overseeing all, and penetrating through all spirits that are intelligent, pure, and altogether subtle. 24 For wisdom is more mobile than any motion; because of her pureness she pervades and penetrates all things. [Wis: 7:22-24]

Chapter 10 is a greatest hits for the personified Wisdom. It's a series of short recaps of key bible stories saying how it was Wisdom ("She") that saved the day. Everything that goes well is attributed to Her. Wisdom is given credit for Noah, Lot, Moses, Joseph and more. The key verse for us here is Wis 10:4

> 4 When the earth was flooded because of him [Cain], wisdom again saved it, steering the righteous man [Noah] by a paltry piece of wood [Wis 10:4] 

Noah was not "wise", he did not "have wisdom". The wood did not save Noah, its intentionally belittled to highlight the greatness of his true saviour. Noah floats rudderless on a raft, and it is Her that saves him and steers him. A point that is made again and again throughout is even with the smallest most pathetic thing, salvation comes from Wisdom. She alone saved him.


# 6. Idols in the Wisdom of Solomon

Chapter 6 gives us a foretaste of the principle that will be hammered home throughout the text.

> 7 For the Lord of all will not stand in awe of anyone, or show deference to greatness; because he himself made both small and great, and he takes thought for all alike. [Wis: 6:7]

There is an order to the universe and God, the creator of all things, is above his creation. God does not show deference for his creation. The creator does not bow before the creation.













----------------------------------------------------------------

Next we jump to Chapter 13 where the author begins an exploration idolatry in 6 movements:

1. The futility of worshiping a dead thing (stars) [Wis 13:1-9]
2. The futility of worshiping a dead thing (wood) [Wis 13:10-19]
3. The Wisdom of God and the abominations contrasted [Wis 14:1-14]
4. The worship of depictions as the origin of pagan abominations [Wis 14:15-31]
5. The benefits of worshipping the living God [Wis 15:1-6]
6. The futility of worshiping a dead thing (clay) [Wis 15:7-17]
