This is a response to ["the cross is a pagan symbol of Tammuz"](https://ahnsahnghong.com/en/church-of-god/origin-of-cross/). Its hard to treat this as seriously as I already have.


## Origin of the Cross

The first claim made is that the cross as a religious symbol is derived from Tammuz a Babylonian God who's name started with T (tau).

No primary evidence is cited. With nothing to go on we could dismiss the claim that Romans were worshipping the cross. But for the fun of it, lets play along. 

Sadly, the author is a moron. Even the slightest google will show that Dumuzid (Tammuz) was a Sumerian God, not a Babylonian one. So its name didn't start with T as it was spelled: íåâíç£. Worse, if you look at the one time that Tammuz is featured in scripture, in [Hebrew](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/ezekiel/8-14.htm) its name is spelled ◊î÷∑◊™÷∑÷º◊û÷º÷Ω◊ï÷º◊ñ◊É (no cross).

If you look at how its spelt in the [greek (LXX)](https://biblebento.com/index.html?lxx1i&330.8.14) its spelled with a theta Œ∏,  not a œÑ. The idiot author has misspelled Tammuz name. It would have never been spelt with a T in the entirety of history (except in English).

The basis for this entire argument is based on a tenuous connection founded on a spelling mistake. This is embarrassingly bad theology. The cross is not derived from Tammuz.

# Introduction of the Cross Into the Church

The history presented might be true, I don't know, I'm a protestant so it doesn't really matter to me if crosses were a late introduction. In my church, in my congregation, the parishioners don't have room temperature IQ and understand that our honour, adoration, love, and veneration are for the God in heaven alone (not any object).

And beside, the cross is a fine symbol for Christianity. The early church fathers might not have had crossed on top of their buildings, but they certainly understood the cross (the sign) as a deeply christian symbol.

> At every forward step and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our our clothes and shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the sign. [Tertullian of Carthage, 155-220 AD](https://www.tertullian.org/anf/anf03/anf03-10.htm#P1035_422175)

Even Christ tells us not to avoid the cross but embrace it. The assertion that its nonsense that Christians would use the cross as a symbol for they practice is nonsense.

> 24¬†Then Jesus told his disciples,¬†‚ÄúIf anyone would come after me, let him¬†deny himself and¬†take up his cross and follow me.¬†25¬†For¬†whoever would save his life¬†will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.¬†26¬†For¬†what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or¬†what shall a man give in return for his soul? [Matthew 16:24-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16:24-26&version=ESV)

# Veneration of the Cross is Idolatry

Veneration of the cross is idolatry. The origins of the cross are in the roman crucifixion, not in Tammuz. Christians may create art for didactic purposes, but if they begin to worship or venerate the art then they should stop. If, as the author claims, they can not help but give the cross special meaning then yes they should remove crosses from the church.

The same can be said for any created thing.

# Prophecy About the Cross-Reverence in the History of Israel

The author is an idiot, the Bronze Serpent was a prefiguring of Christ. The early church understood this. Its a prophesy of how Christ will be lifted up and those who believe in him will be saved.

> The serpent struck Adam in paradise and killed him. [It also struck] Israel in the camp and annihilated them. ‚ÄúJust as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, the Son of Man will be lifted up.‚Äù Just as those who looked with bodily eyes at the sign which Moses fastened on the cross lived bodily, so too those who look with spiritual eyes at the body of the Messiah nailed and suspended on the cross and believe in him will live [spiritually]. Thus it was revealed through this brazen [serpent], which by nature cannot suffer, that he who was to suffer on the cross is one who by nature cannot die. [Ephrem The Syrian, Commentary on Tatian‚Äôs Diatessaron](www.catenabible.com/nm21)


# Conclusion

Please stop listening to these [stupid heretics.](https://ahnsahnghong.com/en/about) The founder was  South Korean wacko who was kicked out of the Seventh Day Adventist, and predicted that the world would end in 1988 (and again in 2012), a text book false prophet.

They believe all kinds of nonsense stuff, like their founder being the [second coming of Christ](https://ahnsahnghong.com/en/faq/why-did-ahnsahnghong-come-to-south-korea/), [polytheism,  God is a woman](https://ahnsahnghong.com/en/teaching/elohim-god/), and that the cross is some symbol from a Babylonian god that wasn't from Babylon.
